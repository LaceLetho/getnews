# Documentation and Output Guidelines

## Minimize Unnecessary Output

- Do not create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- Do not generate example files or sample code for demonstration purposes
- Do not write verbose explanations when concise responses suffice

## When Documentation is Acceptable

- Inline code comments for complex logic that aids understanding
- Brief docstrings for public APIs when they clarify non-obvious behavior
- README updates when adding new features that require setup instructions

## Response Style

- Provide direct, actionable responses
- Skip redundant examples unless they serve a specific learning purpose
- Focus on solving the immediate problem rather than teaching general concepts
